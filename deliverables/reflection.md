The Syft SBOM generated only contains a single entry representing the project directory (".") with no detected packages, versions, or language-specific dependencies. Since the M5Cardputer repository is primarily raw C/C++ source code without package manifests or compiled binaries, Syft cannot identify any software components that map to known ecosystems. Therefore when Grype analyzes this SBOM, it finds no packages to be matched in vulnerability databases, leading to a report with zero vulnerabilities as there are no recognized packages or metadata for Grype to assess.
